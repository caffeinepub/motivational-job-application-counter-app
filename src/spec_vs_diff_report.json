  "summary": "Core job-application logging UI and motivational elements were added, but key requested behaviors are missing: a simple one-tap increment action (REQ-1), deletion of entries and corresponding count updates (REQ-2/REQ-3), and the required generated image asset file under the specified public path (REQ-6). Backend persistence is keyed by caller principal but lacks delete/stats methods and uses in-memory Maps only. Several unrequested features were added (user profile setup, access-control initialization, caffeine.ai footer attribution).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Provide a primary action that increments the total applications counter by exactly 1 with immediate visual feedback.",
      "reason": "The UI derives the total from entries length and provides a form to log an entry, but there is no single primary button like “I applied today” that increments by 1 without requiring extra fields; the form requires company and role, so it is not a simple increment action as specified.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Allow deleting an application entry and update the total counter accordingly.",
      "reason": "There is no delete UI in the recent entries list and no backend delete method exposed; therefore the total cannot update after deletion.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes query/update methods needed to fetch stats+entries, add entry, and delete entry (and/or recompute stats), with persistence keyed by the signed-in principal across sessions.",
      "reason": "The backend provides methods to add and fetch entries for the caller, but does not provide any delete-entry method or a stats method; frontend also lacks corresponding hooks/mutations. Persistence is in-memory Maps; the diff does not show stable storage for retention beyond canister lifecycle events.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Add the generated image asset under frontend/public/assets/generated and render it on the home screen without fetching from the backend.",
      "reason": "Home screen references the expected path, but the diff summary does not show the actual image file being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
